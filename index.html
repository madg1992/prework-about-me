      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Kumusta, my name is Mark Gallardo. I'm 27 years old. I was born in 
        Dallas, Texas but I was raised in the beautiful islands of the Philippines.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Carrollton, Texas & Philippines</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy performing and making music with my band</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to work remotely from anywhere around the world and get paid while I travel.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Carrollton, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I really want to travel and experience the world. Being a web developer will allow 
        me to work remotely from anywhere so I can travel and still make money while I go on
        my expeditions around the globe. Life is very short so I want to live it to the fullest and not
        inside a cubicle.
